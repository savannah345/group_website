# Open positions

The Hydroinformatics Group at the University of Virginia is seeking applications for one or more undergraduate and graduate research assistants.

Our lab uses computing to advance understanding of water systems. Openings are available for students interested in research in water resources engineering or in applying data science and software engineering to water systems. We especially seek students with experience using Python, R, and GIS, but experience with these tools is not required. Students in civil and environmental engineering, computer science, computer engineering, systems engineering, environmental science, and data science are encouraged to apply.

Prospective undergraduate applicants are encouraged to review our ongoing projects and submit a concise proposal indicating their interest in a specific project. Please include details about your interest in the project. We welcome unique perspectives on our ongoing projects and encourage you to share any innovative ideas or insights gained from your current coursework! Submit your proposal along with your current resume to Professor Jon Goodall at goodall@virginia.edu. 

For graduate applicants, kindly contact Professor Jon Goodall at goodall@virginia.edu, providing your CV and resume. In your email, list any external or potential funding resources and ensure you submit your application materials to UVA's Civil and Environmental Engineering graduate program, listing Professor Jon Goodall as your advisor of interest.
