### Research Interests

Our research is in the interdisciplinary field of hydroinformatics that combines water resources engineering, hydrology, computer science, and data science. The goal of our research is to leverage advances in computing and data science to address problems and challenges associated with water resources management such as improving community and infrastructure resilience to climate change. Climate change is resulting in more intense storms and rising sea levels that are causing significant water-related impacts for many communities across the world. We believe that innovations in hydroinformatics can help communities adapt to these new environmental conditions. Below are a few of areas we are currently researching in our team.

#### Smart Stormwater Management

Stormwater infrastructure is designed to mitigate the impacts of urbanization caused by increased runoff. This increased runoff, if not properly handled by stormwater infrastructure, can not only increase flooding risks, but also pollute downstream waterbodies. Many other civil infrastructure systems have benefited from real-time sensing and control capabilities to improve their utility. These capabilities are just now coming to stormwater systems. Taking general approaches and ideas from the broader field of cyber-physical systems (CPS), we are helping to advance smart stormwater systems where real-time sensing and control through actuated gates, valves, and pumps can help to improve the utility of existing systems. Climate change and sea level rise are major drivers for this needed change where existing infrastructure could be enhanced at a lower cost to better address changing environmental conditions.   

#### Urban Flooding

While our ability to forecast severe weather has significantly improved over past decades, our ability to forecast on-the-ground flooding impacts at a high spatial resolution is lacking. This problem is challenging due to the complexity of modeling floods over landscapes, especially urban landscapes or landscapes with low topographic relief. We are advancing computational methods, data management schemes, and GIS-based visualization approaches for urban flooding. We are interested in decision support systems to engage stakeholders in flood warning and disaster response. Much of this work is focused on impacts to transportation and other critical infrastructure before, during, and following flooding events.

#### Advanced Cyberinfrastructure for Hydrologic Modeling

Underlying these advances is the need for novel cyberinfrastructure to support hydrologic modeling and data analysis at scale. This cyberinfrastructure must enable access to high performance computing (HPC), cloud computing, automated workflows, geospatial data analysis, containerization of legacy modeling codes, and other advances needed for the general reproducibility of computational hydrologic modeling. We have been long-term members of national teams building advanced cyberinfrastructure for the hydrologic science and engineering communities through our partnership with the Consortium for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI). This research has resulted in the CUAHSI Hydrologic Information System (his.cuahsi.org) and the CUAHSI HydroShare system (www.hydroshare.org). It has also resulted in partnerships with computer scientists funded through the NSF EarthCube and related cyberinfrastructure programs to advance the state of the art in scientific cyberinfrastructure.
